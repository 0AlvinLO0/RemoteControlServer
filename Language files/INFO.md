Translations
===================

You can find text files containing the store descriptions and xml files containing strings used in the app [here](https://github.com/Steppschuh/RemoteControlServer/tree/master/Language%20files). Please feel free to change texts or add new files if your native language doesn't exist yet.

Always use the files from the [default values](https://github.com/Steppschuh/RemoteControlServer/tree/master/Language%20files/values) directory as base for any translations.

Please create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) (or contact us via mail) if you want to contribute your changes.

If you help us improving the app, you will get an unlimited unlock code as a reward for your efforts.
